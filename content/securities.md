**Securities/Funds overview**
```
Securities / funds is a collective investment scheme where money from many investors is pooled together to purchase short term, low risk and highly liquid debt instruments.

A professional fund manager invests this pooled money in assets like treasury bills, commercial paper and fixed deposits, and the returns are distributed to the investors, minus a management fee.

This structure provides investors with a way to earn a return on their savings while still having easy access to their cash.
