**What are Bulk Emails?**

The **Bulk Emails** page is used when you need to send one message to a large group of clients at the same time. Instead of sending individual emails, you prepare the content once and send it to all selected recipients in a single action.

This is useful for general announcements, marketing campaigns and reminders that apply to many clients, and helps ensure that everyone receives the same information.
