### Control categories
**What are Control Categories?**

**Control Categories** are configuration groups that help the system administrator manage visibility and access rules across Unit Master. Instead of configuring each user or client individually, you create a category and link it to multiple users or clients.

Once a control category is assigned to a client or user, it normally stays the same and ensures consistent behaviour for access rights and restrictions.
