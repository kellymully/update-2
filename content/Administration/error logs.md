**What are error logs**
**Error Logs** are a technical record of failures or unexpected behaviour in the system. Whenever Unit Master encounters an error, information about the problem is written to the log so that it can be reviewed later.

These logs are mainly used by system administrators and developers to understand what went wrong, reproduce the issue if needed, and apply a fix to improve system stability.
