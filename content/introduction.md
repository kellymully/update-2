### Securities/Funds

```
Securities/Funds is a collective investment scheme where money from many investors is pooled together to purchase short-term, low-risk, and highly liquid debt instruments.

A professional fund manager invests this pooled money in assets such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and fixed deposits. The returns generated from these investments are distributed to the investors, after deducting a management fee.

This structure provides investors with a way to earn a return on their savings while still having easy access to their cash, making it suitable for both individual and institutional investors looking for capital preservation and liquidity.

#### Transaction

```
The Transactions section is where all money movements are handled. Here you can make withdrawals, switch between your different accounts, and transfer funds from one account to another.

It gives you a clear view of how money is coming in and going out of your accounts, helping both operations teams and clients track activity quickly and accurately.
```

### Repports

```
The Reports section provides a summary of key information about clients and agents. It brings together important data in one place so that you can quickly review client activity, agent performance, and other high-level trends that support monitoring and decision-making.

Unit Master records purchases, redemptions and computes the fund value after fees so that the reports always reflect accurate and up-to-date positions.
```

### Statements

```
The Statements section gives you a detailed record of account activity over a selected period. It shows the amounts deposited, the funds invested, and the interest earned.

This helps clients track how their money is growing and verify all movements on their accounts, making audits and client queries easier to handle.
```

### Finance

```
Fund expenses are accrued daily and reduce the daily fund value. Typical expenses include management fee, trust fee, and custody fee.

These costs are calculated on a daily basis and usually deducted monthly from the fund, ensuring that valuations, NAVs and client statements correctly reflect net performance after fees.
